# JRDB-Reasoning: A Difficulty-Graded Benchmark for Visual Reasoning in Robotics

## Overview
JRDB-Reasoning is a difficulty-graded benchmark designed to evaluate visual reasoning
capabilities in real-world robotic perception systems. Built on top of the JRDB dataset,
the benchmark introduces structured spatial-temporal reasoning tasks for
Visual Grounding (VG) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), with explicit control over
spatial and temporal complexity.

The benchmark aims to facilitate systematic evaluation of reasoning-based perception
models in robotics, beyond pure detection and tracking.

## Key Features
- Difficulty-graded reasoning tasks with controllable spatial and temporal complexity
- Support for Visual Grounding (VG) and Visual Question Answering (VQA)
- Spatial-temporal scene graph construction from robotic sensor data
- Designed for real-world, human-centric robotic environments

## Code Structure
- `Main.py`  
  Entry point for dataset generation and task construction.

- `graph.py`  
  Spatial-temporal scene graph construction and entity-relation modeling.

- `VG_task.py`  
  Visual Grounding task generation logic.

- `VQA_task.py`  
  Visual Question Answering task generation logic (Wh- and Count-type questions).

- `Classes.py`  
  Core data structures used for representing reasoning samples.

- `global_functions.py`  
  Helper and utility functions used across the pipeline.

- `Category.py`  
  Definition of semantic categories, attributes, and reasoning vocabularies.

## Setup

### Requirements
Python 3.8+ is recommended.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Download the Dataset

Please download the JRDB dataset directly from the official website:

👉 https://jrdb.erc.monash.edu/

You need to register and obtain access in order to download the dataset.
After downloading, set the local dataset paths in `config.local.yaml`
(or update `data_root` in `config.example.yaml`) before running the code.
